# Black-Dox - Educational Cybersecurity Project  

## Description  
This project is an **educational** tool designed to demonstrate how websites can collect user information and send it to a **Discord webhook** in real time. The goal is to raise awareness about online tracking, data privacy, and the importance of cybersecurity best practices.

The system gathers and sends the following user data to a configured **Discord webhook**:  
- **IP Address**: Used for geolocation (approximates user location).  
- **Geolocation**: Latitude and longitude (if user grants permission).  
- **Device Information**: OS, browser type, and screen resolution.  
- **Hardware Specs**: CPU cores and available RAM.  
- **Network Latency**: Measures delay between user and server.  
- **Battery Status**: Current battery percentage and charging state.  
- **Microphone & Camera Access**: Detects if they are enabled.  
- **Cookies & Tab Focus**: Checks if cookies are enabled and if the user is actively viewing the page.  
- **Mouse Movements & Scroll Activity**: Tracks basic user interaction.
